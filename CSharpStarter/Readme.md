> If you're trying to run this you should have the .NetCore3.1 Runtime installed

## Running

This is a `dotnet core 3.1` console app, so just run:

```shell
dotnet run
```

## Creating your own

This is quite simple, just create a new console app:

```
dotnet new console -f netcoreapp3.1
```

And then add `Speckle.Core` as a dependency

```
dotnet add package Speckle.Core --version 2.1.22
```
